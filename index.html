            <p>Isometric action game with an emphasis on overwhelming numbers and unbalanced odds. The player must navigate a series of arenas filled with hordes of enemies. Subsequent areas add new enemy types and a new weapon for the player to use. The player's weapons attack on their own but can unleash a powerful ability by using charge gained from killing enemies. </p>

            <p>This project was created for Abertay's Professional Project module where students from several discplines working as a team to create a prototype based on a brief from an external client. With one other programmer on the team I developed all of the player driven functionality while they developed the enemy and level functionality.</p>

            <p>Throughout the module we used several tools like Jira and Perforce to simulate what it could be like in a real work environment. We also adhered to the agile development methodology by splitting development into sprints and performing stand up, planning and retrospective meetings. </p>

            <strong>Core Contributions:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>UI: Player HUD and menu functionality.</li>
                <li>Camera hiding terrain that obstructs view of the player.</li>
                <li>Create a weapon template that allows designers to easily add more weapons</li>
                <li>Player auto attack, special attack and aiming functionality.</li>
                <li>Simple saving and loading between levels.</li>
                <li>Cosmetic effects such as hitstop.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Development Time: 4 months</p>
            <p>Team Size: 8</p>
            <p>Tools Used: Unreal Engine 5, Blueprint and C++</p>

            <img src="images/301-showcase.gif" , alt="Graphics Showcase">
            <p>A piece of coursework that demonstrates an understanding of several graphics programming techniques. Every technique in the scene has several parameters that can be customised such as the total height of the vertex manipulation.</p>

            <h5> List of Features:</h5>
            <ul class="ulCentre">
                <li>Sine wave ocean and height map terrain.</li>
                <li>Up to 8 lights with working shadows. Light can either be a directional light, point light or spotlight.</li>
                <li>Depth of field with optimised Gaussian blur.</li>
                <li>Tesselation based on camera position.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Development Time: 1 month</p>
            <p>Team Size: Solo</p>

            <h3>Unreal Behaviour Tree</h3>
            <img src="images/behaviour-tree-showcase.gif" , alt="Graphics Showcase">

            <p>Coursework created to demonstrate how behaviour for guards in a stealth game can be created through the use of behaviour trees. This project uses a custom behaviour tree implementation as opposed to Unreal's built-in solution.</p>
            <br>

            <h5> Main Behvaiour:</h5>
            <ul class="ulCentre">
                <li>Patrol a set path, stopping at locations set by the level creator.</li>
                <li>If a player is seen for a set time, investigate their last seen position</li>
                <li>If the player is seen again while investigating, chase after them until line of sight is lost</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Development Time: 3 Weeks</p>
            <p>Team Size: Solo</p>
            <p>Built using: Unreal Engine 5</p>
